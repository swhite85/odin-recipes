# Odin Project Recipe Site

A project building a site for recipes

In this project I'm demonstrating the skills in building out HTML structure using titles, headings, images, links, ordered lists, and unodrdered lists. I'm also utilizing git with atomic commits, concise commit messages and pushing to remote repository form my local miachine.
