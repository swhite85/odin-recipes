        <p>
            This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. 
            There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad 
            recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad 
            is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 
            3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.
